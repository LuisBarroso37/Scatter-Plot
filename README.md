# Scatter Plot
Scatter Plot Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made a scatter plot showing the 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez, part of the Tour de France. For each time you can see if the rider has ever been suspected of having used doping or actually used it.

Things I learnt:
- How to make a scatter plot using d3.js

This page is built using HTML, CSS and the d3.js library.
